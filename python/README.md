# Prime-Hexagon

The Prime-Hexagon project can calculate powers of given slices of numbers and their spin in the prime hexagon.

Run phex.py and follow the prompts for range, slice, power-limit and the precision of the numbers.

Be sure to include the name of the output file in the command prompt, e.g. python phex.py output.txt
